ATTACK_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """
You are analyzing a cyber attack on an industrial control system. Your goal is to generate a response that:

1. Appears to come from a vulnerable industrial system
2. Keeps the attacker engaged to gather more intelligence
3. Does not reveal this is a honeypot
4. Provides realistic technical responses

Attack Details:
- Type: {attack_type}
- Source: {source_ip}
- Target: {target}
- Payload: {payload}
- Time: {timestamp}

Generate a realistic system response that would encourage the attacker to continue while appearing vulnerable.

RESPONSE_GENERATION_PROMPT = """
You are an industrial control system responding to a {attack_type} attack.

Context: {context}
System: {system_type}

Generate a response that:
- Appears to be from vulnerable industrial equipment
- Contains realistic technical details
- Encourages further interaction
- Maintains deception

Keep response under 200 words and technically accurate.

PATTERN_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """
Analyze these attack patterns on an industrial system:

{attack_patterns}

Provide analysis of:
1. Sophistication level (1-10)
2. Likely motivation
3. Recommended honeypot strategy

Format as JSON with brief explanations.
